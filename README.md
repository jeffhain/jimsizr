Jimsizr stands for Java Image reSizer (JIS for short).

Jimsizr provides an API to convert between BufferedImage objects,
doing both type conversion and resizing as needed, possibly in parallel.
Ex.:
```
Jimsizr.resize(
    ScalingType.BOXSAMPLED, // downscaling type
    ScalingType.BICUBIC, // upscaling type
    srcImage,
    dstImage,
    parallelExecutor); // can be null
```

One of the main points of this library, other than allowing
for speed-up with parallelism (which in case of drawImage() usage
introduces small color components inaccuracies, due to how clipping
is handled), is to also allow for better speed and/or accuracy
through use of intermediary images, because for some image types
AWT's drawImage() can be very inaccurate and/or very slow.

The available scaling algorithms are: NEAREST, BILINEAR, BICUBIC,
BOXSAMPLED, ITERATIVE_BILINEAR, and ITERATIVE_BICUBIC.
Except for BOXSAMPLED, they are already implemented by AWT,
or can be simply for iterative ones, which allows for
good performances (when ending up in optimized C code).
Scaling algorithms are chosen independently for the downscaling
and the upscaling part, which is useful in case of non-uniform scaling.
Cf. ScalingType javadoc for more information.

This library also provides (and uses) the BufferedImageHelper class,
which provides efficient read, write and copy operations, including
for a few easily useful (e.g. for OpenGL) int-array based custom types.

The class JimsizrTestGuiMain launches a GUI for exploratory testing
(speed and quality, depending on algorithms and spans resizing)
with sample images.
